## What is Fandalizer?
Fandalizer is a project inspired by the Facebook page [Taidevandalismi](https://www.facebook.com/taidevandalismi/). (in Finnish)
I set out to build an online tool to quickly make your own contributions to this wonderful ~~cult~~ community without the need to open Photoshop (especially if you don't have it).

The project will also serve as a meaningful way for me to learn more JS.

## Features
(None yet really, will update this section as the app is more complete.)
